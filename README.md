# Status code analyzer
This small program logs into Discord and counts the usage of status codes in the message history. The data is exported to `data/out.ods`.

## Usage
Setup and launching this tool works pretty much the same as the [main AI](https://github.com/HexCorpProgramming/HexCorpDiscordAI).
